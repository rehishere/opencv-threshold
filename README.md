# opencv-threshold
A Python code using OpenCV and tkinter to show a camera flow in 2 colors to enable low vision people to read text comfortably.

# Dependencies
* opencv-python
* tkinter
* numpy
* threading

# The goal
Some CCTV magnifiers uses threshold with adjusted hardware settings (light for example) to show text in different color modes (which are linited by the way) in order to make it easier for people with low vision to read certain mamterials.
My goal with this project is to be able to offer the same experience with a simple program that allows you use a standard camera to read things. It might seem useless as it can easly be done with a smartphone, but I would like this project to evolve into a full visual assistive technology suite with reader and magnification tobe able to read content that cannot be retrieved digitally.

# How to use the program
SImply execute python opencv-threshold.py and it will open two color pickers to choose what colors suits you the best for reading.
